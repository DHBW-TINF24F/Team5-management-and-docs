## 1. Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this Customer Requirements Specification (CRS) is to define the business-oriented needs and expectations for the enhancement of the Eclipse Mnestix Product Catalog, a web-based application designed for the visualization and management of Asset Administration Shells (AAS) within Industry 4.0 environments.

The project aims to improve usability, performance, and functional completeness of the Mnestix Product Catalog by addressing existing shortcomings and implementing new features that make the platform more accessible to non-technical users such as engineers, product managers, and customers in said industrial settings.

This document does not include technical implementation details but focuses on the requirements from a customer and stakeholder perspective.

### Objectives
- Enhance the user interface (UI) for improved clarity and responsiveness.  
- Introduce configuration flexibility for connected repositories.  
- Improve data visualization and filtering capabilities within product listings.  
- Integrate external tools such as the Nameplate Generator directly into the user workflow.  
- Ensure compatibility with existing BaSyx and AAS infrastructures.

---

## 2. Project Context

### 2.1 Background
Eclipse Mnestix is an open-source project that provides a web-based interface for exploring and managing Asset Administration Shells â€” the digital representations of industrial assets defined under the Industry 4.0 standard.  
The project aligns with initiatives from the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA) and integrates with infrastructures such as Eclipse BaSyx.

Current Mnestix implementations primarily target developers and technical users. The usability and visual clarity of its product catalog are limited, leading to a steep learning curve for less technical stakeholders.
In order to provide a much simpler and more efficient user experience, this project focuses on enhancing the Mnestix Product Catalog to better serve a broader audience such as product managers and customers.

### 2.2 Project Scope
The scope of this project includes:
- Enhancement of the Mnestix Product Catalog web interface.
- Integration of usability improvements and visual redesigns.
- Implementation of asynchronous data loading and advanced filtering.
- Connection with the Nameplate Generator for generating product labels.
- Validation of the improved catalog against multiple AAS servers.

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder | Role / Interest | Expectations | Influence |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **End Users (Engineers, Product Managers)** | Daily users of the catalog | Simple navigation, clear data presentation, stable performance | High |
| **Developers / Maintainers** | Implement new features and fix issues | Clean modular architecture, minimal technical debt, good documentation | High |
| **Eclipse & IDTA** | Ecosystem coordinators | Alignment with Industry 4.0 standards | Medium |
| **Academic Supervisors / Project Sponsors** | Oversight and evaluation | Comprehensive documentation, measurable improvement and requirement satisfaction | Medium |
| **Community Contributors** | Potential future maintainers | Clear contribution guidelines, usable interface, understandable codebase | Low |

## 4. Current Situation and Problem Statement

### 4.1 Existing System
The current Mnestix Product Catalog provides:
- Access to AAS repositories through a technical interface.
- Visualization of AAS data and associated submodels.
- Basic configuration of connected repositories.

### 4.2 Identified Problems
- **Usability issues:** Non-intuitive interface layout, limited user guidance.
- **Performance issues:** Repository loading can take long and blocks the UI. Loading of Thumbnails for all products at once causes delays.
- **Lack of configurability:** Repositories cannot be selectively enabled or disabled.
- **Poor data visibility:** Insufficient support for filtering, sorting, and previewing data.
- **Visual inconsistencies:** Misaligned formatting and table rendering in submodel views.
- **Limited integration:** No seamless access in the user flow to related tools such as the Nameplate Generator.
- **Missing eShop functionality:** Users cannot interactively add products to a cart or view selected items.

### 4.3 Business Impact
These issues limit the adoption of the Mnestix Product Catalog in industrial contexts, particularly by non-developers. Improving usability and accessibility is crucial for broader acceptance and alignment with Industry 4.0 usability expectations.
Completing this project will enhance user satisfaction and will therefore increase the user base. It will also increase productivity and promote the use of digital twins in industrial applications.
