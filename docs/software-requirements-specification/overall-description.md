# Overall description

## Product perspective

Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state
whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing
systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system,
relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify
interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall
system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
